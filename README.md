Service Oriented Architecture 
is a architecture that guides
 users in developing a software 
where they use the used components 
or services of the software to create something new.


There are 9 characteristics of SOA, the first one is 
Standardized Service Contrracts is the need to believe or follow 
a certain service description for the user's satisfaction. Next one is Loose Coupling, where it needs to lessen the
dependencies of a service to another to create boundaries with less vulnerability. Another is Abrastraction that 
hides unnecessary information to the client which might lead to confusion. Next is Service Reusability where
they use an old service to create multiple new services. Another one is Autonomy which it needs to be
precise when it comes to the logic to avoid misinformation or confusion. Next is Statelessness where it should not
be too complicated so that it can be recycled or improved. Another one is Discoverability where the service should 
be easy to access to avoid unreliability. Next one is Composability which the services should be reliable
in terms of solving problems with a composed process for it to be effecient. Last one is Interoperability
which means that the service should be flexible in terms of other users.




Microservices are architectures that makes reusable and new components but rather than making it in a single
application, they create a new application with each component for the services be more flexible and spacewise.



There are 3 main benefits of using microservices, and the first one is microservices is independently deployable.
Being an independent services lessens deadlocks when it comes with communication because of the bounderies that
they have and due of the service having applications individually.Second is it is Right tool for the job, where 
each services has it own application which is good for communication with minumum interferance. Lastly, it's 
Precise Scaling, as mentioned earlier that services can be individually deployed, then it can be monitored properly
with minimum errors.



The difference of Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices is SOA is an enterprise-wide effort architecture
which means that it works generally. On the other hand, Microservices is an application-specific that means it works
specifically.
For the similarities of the two, both architectures reuse a compenent and create a new specialized component.
